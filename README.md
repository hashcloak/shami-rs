# shami-rs

This repository contains a very basic implementation of Shamir secret-sharing
with semi-honest security for honest majority in Rust. The implementation is
not intended to be production-ready. Instead, the implementation aims to be an
educational resource on how to implement Shamir secret-sharing from scratch.

This project does not consider the following features yet:

- Private and reliable communication channels.
- The network implementation does not consider delays in the communication.
- There are not enough tests.
- The implementation is not performant.
